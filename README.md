# SpatialTranscriptomics YouTube

In this repository I thought it would be a fun project to go through the Nanostring CosMx SMI data. Here, we will be using the [human frontal cortex](https://nanostring.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/human-frontal-cortex-ffpe-dataset/) dataset that uses their upgraded 6000-plex technology. This is part of a series on Youtube.

1. My first video was talking a little bit about spatial transcriptomics and downloading the dataset [here](https://youtu.be/_qsHqB67O70).
2. Second video is exploring the Seurat object and looking at some of the resolutions that we have (slide, field of view, cellular) [here](https://youtu.be/f4d4-PVrtiI)
3. Cleaning the Seurat object, running normalization, PCA/UMAP, and clustering [here](https://youtu.be/2PWqvFaOwBw)
